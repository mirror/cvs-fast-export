= Hacker's guide to cvs-fast-export =

cvs-fast-export is a complex program doing an intrinsically difficult
job.  Because analyzing CVs repositories has lots of strang edge
cases, it is likely to need modification in the future.  This document
is a collection of notes intended to make that less intimidating.

== History ==

This program was originally written as a one-off hack by Keith Packard
in early 2006, when he was working on migrating the X repositories
from CVS to git, and was not originally intended to survive that
conversion.  It was called "parsecvs" then.  It called git tools
directly to create translated repositories.

The code was briefly maintained by Bart Massey before passing to Eric
S. Raymond in late 2012. ESR wrote the fast-export output stage and
renamed the program to reflect its new function.

Most of ESR's original contributions are in export.c, which is why
that code is in a somewhat different style than the rest of the
codebase. ESR also split the original commit structure into
cvs_commit and git_commit as a space optimization. and rescued 
the rather decrepit code for generating graphviz visualizations.

A few  other people have contributed significant improvements 
since, mainly performance tweaks.  Most notably: Jens Bethkowsky 
<jens.bethkowsky@rwth-aachen.de> added a red-black-tree implementation
to speed up symbol search, and Aidan Hobson Sayers <aidanhs@cantab.net>
replaced on O(n**3) sort with an O(n log n).

Large portions of this code remain a trackless jungle of complex 
algorithms with poorly documented assumptions.  Only Keith ever
completely understood it, and he does no longer.  Others have been
able to modify it mainly by isolating pieces that they could 
comprehend without having to grok the whole.

== Operation ==

This program operates in three stages.  The first (analysis) digests a
collection of RCS masters into a collection of linked lists and
structures representing per-file revision trees.  The second
(resolution) massages the revision trees into a DAG (directed acyclic
graph) of changesets.  The third stage (export) emits a report on the
DAG structure, either a fast-export stream expressing it or DOT code
for a visualization that can be rendered by graphviz.

The main sequence of the code is, unsurprisingly, in the main() portion
of the file main.c

=== Analysis stage ===

The main function of this stage is rev_list_file().

CVS files consist of a header section describing symbols and
attributes, followed by a set of deltas (add-delete/change
sequences) one per revision number.

The analysis stage uses a yacc/lex grammar to parse headers in CVS
files, and custom code to resolve deltas into whole-file snaphots
corresponding to each delta. These snapshots are stashed in a 
temporary directory, later to become blobs in the fast-export stream.

After some study of the structures in cvs.h, most of the analysis code
will be fairly straightforward to understand. The exception is the
actual delta resolution in generate.c, which is seriously
hairy. Fortunately, that part of the CVS master format has (unlike the
header and attribute information) been extremely stable, and thus this
code is unlikely to require modification.

If you have to modify this code, it will most likely involve some
small addition to the parse grammar to handle an attribute particular 
to somebody's variation on CVS.

=== Resolution stage ===

The main function of this stage is rev_list_merge().  All the really
black magic happens inside it.  Nobody understands all of this
code; a few people have managed to comprehend individual pieces of
it.

=== Export stage ===

The export third stage is relatively easy to understand.
It takes the annotated DAG produced by the second stage and the
file snapshots generated by the first, and emits either a
fast-import stream or a DOT representation of the DAG.

The only tricky part of this code is comprehending the data
structures it consumes.  That's our next topic.

== Data structures ==

This program is rife with tricky data structures. If you want to
modify it, the first thing you should do is read the definitions
in cvs.h.

The first stage turns each CVS file into a rev_list - a linked tree of
rev_ref objects, each of which encapulates a CVS commit and contains a
pointer to a cvs_commit structure.  The rev_list contains a list named
"heads" which is so called because the members represent branch heads.

During the resolution phase, the trees associated with individual
files are transformed into a single set of rev_list objects
representing a commit DAG. At this point. the commit pointers 
change semantics to refer to git_commit objects; a certain amount
of type punning is involved.

The export code walks the resulting single revlist generating a
report from it.

A notable feature of the git_commit structures is that the code goes
to great lengths to space-optimize (pack) the representation of file
paths in the commit at the point when it is synthesized (this is
required in order to hold down the orogram's working-set size on large
repositories).  After packing, paths are represented by structure
trees that coalesce common path prefixes.

== Source flles ==

=== atom.c  ===

The main entry point, atom(), interns a string, avoiding having
separate storage for duplicate copies. No ties to other structures.
The only complexity here is a straightforward hash implementation to
speed up collision searches.

=== authormap.c ===

Manages a map from short CVS-syle names to DVCS-style name/email
pairs. Added by ESR, it has few ties to the core code.

=== cvsnumber.c ===

Various small functions (mostly predicates) on the cvs_number objects 
that represent CVS revision numbers (1.1, 1.2, 2.1.3.1 and the like).
No coupling to other structures.

=== cvsutil.c  ===

Code for managing and freeing objects in a CVS file structure.
No coupling to revlist handling.

=== dump.c ===

Dump functionds for graphing and debug instrumentation.
Much of the code in here is obsolete and unused.

=== export.c ===

Code to dump a resolved DAG as a git-fast-export strea,.  Replaces
much more obscure code in Keith's original that built git repos
directly by calling the git CLI. The only coupling to the core 
data structures is that it traverses the DAG created by the resolution
stage.

=== generate.c  ===

Convert the sequence of deltas in a CVS master to a corresponding
sequence of file snapshots. This is the part of the analysis stage
most likely to make your brain hurt.

=== gram.y  ===

This is the part of the analysis stage *least* likely to make your
brain hurt.  A fairly straightforward yacc grammar for CVS masters.
Builds a cvs_file structure named this_file which is global across the
program; wherever you see it you can be sure you're in the analysis pass.

=== graph.c  ===

Like export.c, but emits DOT rather than a fast-export stream.  Takes
the DAG generated by the analysis stage and turns it into a
description of the graph in the DOT markup language used by the
graphviz tools.

=== import.c ===

Import/analysis of a collection of CVS master files.  Calls the parser
and builds the first-stage revlist. The complicated part is in the 
rev_list_cvs() call, which calls out to revcvs.c.

=== lex.l  ===

The lexical analyzer for the grammar in gram.y.  Pretty straightforward.

=== main.c  ===

The main sequence of the code.  Not much else there other than some
fairly simple time and date handling.

=== nodehash.c  ===

Manage Node structures, an obscure bit of internals used in the
analysis stage (and maybe resolution too).  This is one of the
parts nobody understands.

=== rbtree.c  ===

This is an optimization hack to speed up CVS symbol lookup, added
well after the main body of the code was written and decoupled
from the core data structures.

=== revcvs.c  ===

Black magic begins here.  Build the in-core revision lists
corresponding to a single CVS master.  Just one entry point,
rev_list_cvs(), which takes the structure built by the grammar parse
of the master as its single argument. Nobody fully understands the
data structures this builds.

=== revdir.c  ===

The least incomprehensible part of the core code.  These functions are
used to pack file paths in rev_file objects into a more
space-efficient representation.

=== revlist.c  ===

Black magic continues here.  Core code used in analysis and resolution.
Nobody understands this either. The main function (and the least
comprehensible) is rev_branch_merge().  Which is, alas, the
algorithmic heart of the entire program.

=== tags.c  ===

Manage objects representing CVS tags (and later, git lightweight
tags). These data structures reference and are referenced by the
core structures, but the coupling is relatively loose and
well-defined; you can figure out what is going on by reading
the function names.

=== utils.c  ===

The progress meter, various private memory allocators, abd
error-reporting.  No coupling to the core data structures.

== Known problems in the code ==

Fileop generation in the export stage is an O(n^2) hog, dominating the
program's runtime.  The hotspot is compute_parent_links().

There's a comment in rev_list_merge() that says "Yes, this is
currently very inefficient".  That is a probable hotspot.

The fact that nobody really understands the resolution algorithm is
worrying.  It means nobody has much hope of fixing it where it breaks.

What is up with 'tail' and the other bitfields in the core structures?

== Good practice ==

When modifying this code, run the regression tests (make check) early
and often.  It is very easy to break even with apparently innocuous 
changes.

If you find a bug and fix it, please try to create a toy repo exhibiting
the problem - or, better yet, a minimal set of operations to reproduce
it. Then add that to the regression tests.

Likewise, when adding a feature, add a test for it as well.

If you figure out something about the code that isn't documented here
- or, especially, if it's documented wrongly - please include an
explanation with your patch.
