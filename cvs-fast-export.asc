== DESCRIPTION ==
cvs-fast-export tries to group the per-file commits and tags in a RCS file
collection or CVS project repository into per-project changeset
commits with common metadata, in the style of Subversion and later
version-control systems.

This tool is best used in conjunction with reposurgeon(1).  Plain
cvs-fast-export conversions contain various sorts of fossils that
reposurgeon is good for cleaning up. See the
http://www.catb.org/esr/dvcs-migration-guide.html[DVCS Migration
HOWTO] to learn about the sanity-checking and polishing steps
required for a really high-quality conversion, including reference
lifting and various sorts of artifact cleanup.

If arguments are supplied, the program assumes all ending with the
extension ",v" are master files and reads them in. If no arguments are
supplied, the program reads filenames from stdin, one per
line. Directories and files not ending in ",v" are skipped.
(But see the description of the -P for how to change this behavior.) 

Files from either Unix CVS or CVS-NT are handled. If a collection of
files has commitid fields, changesets will be constructed reliably
using those.

In the default mode, which generates a git-style fast-export stream to
standard output:

* The prefix given using the -s option or, if the option is omitted, the
  longest common prefix of the paths is discarded from each path.

* Files in CVS Attic and RCS directories are treated as though the "Attic/"
  or "RCS/" portion of the path were absent.  This usually restores the
  history of files that were deleted.

* Permissions on all fileops related to a particular file will be
  controlled by the permissions on the corresponding master.  If the
  executable bit on the master is on, all its fileops will have 100755
  permissions; otherwise 100644.

* A set of file operations is coalesced into a changeset if either (a) they
  all share the same commitid, or (b) all have no commitid but
  identical change comments, authors, and modification dates within
  the window defined by the time-fuzz parameter.  Unlike some other
  exporters, no attempt is made to derive changesets from shared tags.

* Commits are issued in time order unless the cvs-fast-export detects
  that some parent is younger than its child (this is unlikely but
  possible in cases of severe clock skew). In that case you will see a
  warning on standard error and the emission order is guaranteed
  topologically correct, but otherwise not specified (and is subject to
  change in future versions of this program).

* CVS tags become git lightweight tags when they can be unambiguously
  associated with a changeset.  If the same tag is attached to file
  deltas that resolve to multiple changesets, it is reported as if 
  attached to the last of them.

* The HEAD branch is renamed to 'master'.

* Other tag and branch names are sanitized to be legal for git;
  the characters ~^\*? are removed.

* Since .cvsignore files have a syntax upward-compatible with that of
  .gitignore files, they're renamed.  In order to simulate the default
  ignore behavior of CVS, those defaults are prepended to root
  .cvsignore blobs renamed to .gitignore, and a root .gitignore
  containing the defaults is generated if no such blobs exist.

See the later section on RCS/CVS LIMITATIONS for more information on
edge cases and conversion problems.

This program does not depend on any of the CVS metadata held outside
the individual content files (e.g. under CVSROOT).

The variable TMPDIR is honored and used when generating a temporary
directory in which to store file content during processing.

== OPTIONS ==
-h::
Display usage summary.

-w 'fuzz'::
Set the timestamp fuzz factor for identifying patch sets in seconds.
The default is 300 seconds. This option is irrelevant for changesets
with commitids.

-k::
Specify RCS/CVS keyword expansion.  You can specify any of the CVS
keyword expansion types: "kv" (keyword-value), "kvl"
(keyword-value-locker), "k" (keyword only), "v" (value only), "o" (no
expansion), or "b" (binary - no exansion, no line ending
conversion). CVS's rules are: (1) if the master has -kb set in its
internal keyword field, do that, otherwise (2) if an expansion type
was set on the command line, do that, otherwise (3) if the file's
internal keyword field is set, do that, otherwise use kv.
cvs-fast-export behaves slightly differently; the default is kb rather
than kkv, kvl is treated like kv, and ko is treated like kb (that
is, no end-of-line normalization is ever performed).

-g::
generate a picture of the commit graph in the DOT markup language
used by the graphviz tools, rather than fast-exporting.

-l::
Warnings normally go to standard error.  This option, which takes a
filename, allows you to redirect them to a file>  Convenient
with the -p option.

-a::
Dump a list of author IDs found in the repository, rather than fast-exporting.

-C::
Force canonical order (same as git-fast-export's) in the emitted
stream. Blobs are emitted as late as possible before the commits that
require them. It reduces throughput by about a factor of two.  Repositories
in which the time order of commits is inconsistent with their
topological order will produce malformed fast-export streams in -C
mode; these will crash Git's importer.

-F::
Force fast order. Blobs are emitted first, then commits.

-A 'authormap'::
Apply an author-map file to the attribution lines. Each line must be
of the form
+
------------------------------------------------------
ferd = Ferd J. Foonly <foonly@foo.com> America/Chicago
------------------------------------------------------
+
and will be applied to map the Unix username 'ferd' to the DVCS-style
user identity specified after the equals sign.  The timezone field
(after > and whitespace) is optional and (if present) is used to set
the timezone offset to be attached to the date; acceptable formats for
the timezone field are anything that can be in the TZ environment
variable, including a [+-]hhmm offset. Whitespace around the equals
sign is stripped.  Lines beginning with a # or not containing an
equals sign are silently ignored.

-R 'revmap'::
Write a revision map to the specified argument filename.  Each line of
the revision map consists of three whitespace-separated fields: a
filename, an RCS revision number, and the mark of the commit to which
that filename-revision pair was assigned.  Doesn't work with -g.

-v::
Show verbose progress messages mainly of interest to developers.

-T::
Force deterministic dates for regression testing. Each patchset will
have a monotonic-increasing attributed date computed from its mark in
the output stream - the mark value times the commit time window times two.

--reposurgeon::
Emit for each commit a list of the CVS file:revision pairs composing it as a
bzr-style commit property named "cvs-revisions".  From version 2.12
onward, reposurgeon(1) can interpret these and use them as hints for
reference-lifting.

--embed-id::
Append to each commit comment identification of the CVS commits that
contributed to it.

-V::
Emit the program version and exit.

-e 'remote'::
Exported branch names are prefixed with refs/remotes/'remote' instead of
refs/heads, making the import appear to come from the named remote.

-s 'stripprefix'::
Strip the given prefix instead of longest common prefix

-t 'threadcount'::
Running multithreaded increases the program's memory footprint
proportionally to the number of threads, but means the conversion may
run in less total time because an I/O operation involving one master
file will not block compute-intensive processing of others. By
default, the program conservatively assumes it can use two threads per
processor available. You can use this option to set the number of threads;
the value 0 forces sequential processing with no threading.

-p::
Enable progress reporting. This also dumps statistics (elapsed time
and size of maximum resident set) for several points in the conversion
run.

-P::
Normally cvs-fast-export will skip any filename presented as an argument
or on stdin that does not end with the RCS/CVS extension ",v", and
will also ignore a pathnamre containing the string CVSROOT (this
avoids annoyances when running from or above a top-level CVS directory).
A strict reading of RCS allows masters without the ,v extension.  This
option sets promiscuous mode, disabling both checks.

-i 'date'::
Enable incremental-dump mode. Only commits with a date after that
specified by the argument are emitted. Each branch root in the 
incremental dump is decorated with git-stream magic which, when
interpreted in context of a live repository, will connect that branch 
to any branch of the same name.  The date is expected to be RFC3339
conformant (e.g. yy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ) or else an integer Unix time
in seconds.

If neither -F nor -C is specified, cvs-fast-export will choose a mode
based on the repository size - canonical order for small repositories,
fast for large ones.  Tools that consume git-fast-import streams should not
care; this behavior is for backward compatibility.

== EXAMPLE ==
A very typical invocation would look like this:

----------------------------------------------
find . | cvs-fast-export >stream.fi
----------------------------------------------

Your cvs-fast-export distribution should also supply cvssync(1), a
tool for fetching CVS masters from a remote repository. Using
them together will look something like this:

--------------------------------------------------------------
cvssync anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/sources/groff groff
find groff | cvs-fast-export >groff.fi
--------------------------------------------------------------

Progress reporting can be reassuring if you expect a conversion
to run for some time.  It will animate completion percentages
as the conversion proceeds and display timings when done.

The cvs-fast-export suite contains a wrapper script called
'cvsconvert' that is useful for running a conversion and automatically
checking its content against the CVS original.

== RCS/CVS LIMITATIONS ==
Translating RCS/CVS repositories to the generic DVCS model expressed
by import streams is not merely difficult and messy, there are weird
RCS/CVS cases that cannot be correctly translated at all.
cvs-fast-export will try to warn you about these cases rather than
silently producing broken or incomplete translations, but there be
dragons. We recommend some precautions under SANITY CHECKING.

CVS-NT and versions of GNU CVS after 1.12 (2004) added a changeset
commit-id to file metadata. Older sections of CVS history without
these are vulnerable to various problems caused by clock skew between
clients; this used to be relatively common for multiple reasons,
including less pervasive use of NTP clock synchronization. cvs-fast-export
will warn you ("commits before this date lack commitids") when it sees
such a section in your history. When it does, these caveats apply:

* If timestamps of commits in the CVS repository were not stable
enough to be used for ordering commits, changes may be reported in the
wrong order.

* If the timestamp order of different files crosses the revision order
within the commit-matching time window, the order of commits reported 
may be wrong.

One more property affected by commitids is the stability of old
changesets under incremental dumping. Under a CVS implementation
issuing commitids, new CVS commits are guaranteed not to change
cvs-fast-export's changeset derivation from a previous history;
thus, updating a target DVCS repository with incremental dumps 
from a live CVS installation will work. Even if older portions 
of the history do not have commitids, conversions will be stable.
This stability guarantee is lost if you are using a version of
CVS that does not issue commitids.

Also note that a CVS repository has to be completely reanalyzed 
even for incremental dumps; thus, processing time and memory 
requirements will rise with the total repository size even when
the requested reporting interval of the incremental dump is small.

These problems cannot be fixed in cvs-fast-export; they are inherent to CVS.

== CVS-FAST-EXPORT REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS ==
Because the code is designed for dealing with large data sets, it has
been optimized for 64-bit machines and no particular effort has been
made to keep it 32-bit clean.  Various counters may overflow if you
try using it to lift a large repository on a 32-bit machine.

Branches occurring in only a subset of the analyzed masters are not
correctly resolved; instead, an entirely disjoint history will be
created containing the branch revisions and all parents back to the
root.

CVS vendor branches are a source of trouble. Sufficiently strange
combinations of imports and local modifications will translate
badly, producing incorrect content on master and elsewhere.

Some other CVS exporters try, or have tried, to deduce changesets from 
shared tags even when comment metadata doesn't match perfectly. This
one does not; the designers judge that to trip over too many
pathological CVS tagging cases.

When running multithreaded, there is an edge case in which the
program's behavior is nondeterministic.  If the same tag looks like it
should be assigned to two different gitspace commits with the same
timestamp, which tag it actually lands on will be random.

cvs-fast-export is designed to do translation with all its
intermediate structures in memory, in one pass. This contrasts with
cvs2git(1), which uses multiple passes and journals intermediate
structures to disk.  The tradeoffs are that cvs-fast-export is much
faster than cvs2git, but will fail with an out-of-memory error on CVS
repositories large enough to overflow your physical memory. In
practice, you are unlikely to push this limit on a machine with 16GB
of RAM and effectively certain not to with 32GB.  Attempts to do large
conversions in only a 32-bit (4GB) address space are, on the other
hand, unlikely to end well.

The program's transient storage requirements can be quite a bit
larger; it must slurp in each entire master file once in order to
do delta assembly and generate the version snapshots that will 
become snapshots.  Using the -t option multiplies the expected amount
of transient storage required by the number of threads; use with
care, as it is easy to push memory usage so high that swap overhead
overwhelms the gains from not constantly blocking on I/O.

In -C mode, the program also requires temporary disk space equivalent
to the sum of the sizes of all revisions in all files.  This is not so
in -F mode.

On stock PC hardware in 2014, cvs-fast-export achieves processing
speeds upwards of 64K CVS commits per minute on real repositories.
Time performance is primarily I/O bound and can be improved by running
on an SSD.

== SANITY CHECKING ==
After conversion, it is good practice to do the following verification
steps:

1. If you ran the conversion directly with cvs-fast-export rather than
using cvsconvert, use diff(1) with the -r option to compare a CVS head
checkout with a checkout of the converted repository. The only
differences you should see are those due to RCS keyword expansion,
.cvsignore lifting, and manifest mismatches due to CVS not tracking
file deaths quite correctly.  If this is not true, you may have found a bug
in cvs-fast-export; please report it with a copy of the CVS repo.

2. Examine the translated repository with reposurgeon(1) looking (in
particular) for misplaced tags or branch joins. Often these can be
manually repaired with little effort. These flaws do 'not' necessarily
imply bugs in cvs-fast-export; they may simply indicate previously
undetected malformations in the CVS history. However, reporting them may
help improve cvs-fast-export.

== RETURN VALUE ==

0 if all files were found and successfully converted, 1 otherwise.

== ERROR MESSAGES ==
Most of the messages cvs-fast-export emits are self.explanatory.  Here
are a few that aren't. Where it says "check head", be sure to
sanity-check against the head revision.

tag could not be assigned to a commit::
     RCS/CVS tags are per-file, not per revision. If developers are not
     careful in their use of tagging, it can be impossible to associate a
     tag with any of the changesets that cvs-fast-export resolves. When
     this happens, cvs-fast-export will issue this warning and the tag
     named will be discarded.

child commit emitted before parent::
     Something went wrong diring export canonicalization. This was
     probably caused by CVS commit timestamps being in the wrong order for
     their parent-child relathonship. Try the -F option.

discarding dead untagged branch::
     Analysis found a CVS branch with no tag consisting entirely of
     dead revisions. These cannot have been visible in the archival
     state of the CVS at conversion time; it is possible they may
     have been visible as branch content at some point in the
     repository's past, but without an identifying tag that state
     is impossible to reconstruct.

warning - unnamed branch::
     A CVS branch with a live revision lacks a head label.  A label
     with "-UNNAMED-BRANCH" suffixed to the name of the parent branch
     will be generated.

warning - no master branch generated::
     cvs-fast-export could not identify the default (HEAD) branch and
     therefore there is no "master" in the conversion; this will
     seriously confuse git and probably other VCSes when they try to
     import the output stream. You may be able to identify and rename 
     a master branch using reposurgeon(1).

warning - xxx newer than yyy::
     Early in analysis of a CVS master file, time sort order of its
     deltas doesn't match the topological order defined by the
     revision numbers.  The most likely cause of this is clock skew
     between clients in very old CVS versions. The program will attempt
     to correct for this by tweaking the revision date of the
     out-of-order commit to be that of its parent, but this may not
     prevent other time-skew errors later in analysis.

tip commit older than imputed branch join::
     A similar problem to "newer than" being reported at a later
     stage, when file branches are being knit into changeset branches.
     One CVS branch in a collection about to be merged into a gitspace
     branch has a tip commit older than the earliest commit that is a 
     a parent on some (other) tip in the collection.  The adventious
     branch is snipped off.

some parent commits are younger than children::
     May indicate that cvs-fast-export aggregated some changesets in
     the wrong order; probably harmless, but check head.

warning - branch point later than branch::
     Late in the analysis, when connecting branches to their parents
     in the changeset DAG, the commit date of the root commit of a
     branch is earlier than the date of the parent it gets connected
     to. Could be yet another clock-skew symptom, or might point to
     an error in the program's topological analysis.  Examine commits
     near the join with reposurgeon(1); the branch may need to be
     reparented by hand.

more than one delta with number X.Y.Z::
     The CVS history contained duplicate file delta numbers. Should
     never happen, and may indice a corrupted CVS archive if it does;
     check head.

{revision|patch} with odd depth::
     Should never happen; only branch numbers are supposed to have odd
     depth, not file delta or patch numbers. May indice a corrupted
     CVS archive; check head.

duplicate tag in CVS master, ignoring::
     A CVS master has multiple instances of the same tag pointing at
     different file deltas. Probably a CVS operator error and relatively
     harmless, but check that the tag's referent in the conversion
     makes sense.

tag or branch name was empty after sanitization::
    Fatal error: tag name was empty after all characters illegal for git
    were removed.  Probably indicates a corrupted RCS file.

revision number too long, increase CVS_MAX_DEPTH::
     Fatal error: internal buffers are too short to handle a CVS
     revision in a repo. Increase this constant in cvs.h and rebuild.
     Warning: this will increase memory usage and slow down the tests
     a lot.

snapshot sequence number too large, widen serial_t::
     Fatal error: the number of file snapshots in the CVS repo
     overruns an internal counter.  Rebuild cvs-fast-export from
     source with a wider serial_t patched into cvs.h. Warning: this
     will significantly increase the working-set size

too many branches, widen branchcount_t::
     Fatal error: the number of branches descended from some single
     commit overruns an nternal counter.  Rebuild cvs-fast-export from
     source with a wider branchcount_t patched into cvs.h. Warning:
     this will significantly increase the working-set size

internal error - branch cycle::
     cvs-fast-export found a cycle while topologically sorting commits
     by parent link.  This should never happen and probably indicates
     a serious internal error: please file a bug report.

internal error - lost tag::
     Late in analysis (after changeset coalescence) a tag lost its
     commit reference.  This should never happen and probably indicates
     an internal error: please file a bug report.
