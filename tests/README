= The cvs-fast-export test suite =

You will need RCS and CVS installed to run these tests.

Ensure there is no CVSROOT folder in any parent directory.

There are mutiple groups of tests in this directory.

== Auxiliary tools ==

visualize::
	Visualize the contents of a test repository or master file
	using the -g option of cvs-fast-export and the dot(1) renderer.

gitwassh::
	Canonicalize a git fast-mport stream.

== The .tst files ==

One group is generated by the *.tst files.  These are Python scripts
that use the framework in testlifter.py to create CVS or RCS
repositories (extension .repo) using the local installation of CVS or
RCS.

During normal regression tests or rebuilds, cvs-fast-export is run 
against those repositories and the output compared to check files.
The reason for this organization is to make it easier to modify and
elaborate the tests by changing the generator scripts.

The repo rebuilds are expensive - much slower than the cvs-fast-export
runs.  And they need to be done only when the generator scripts change,
not on every change to the cvs-fast-export code.  In order to speed up
normal testing, the repos are left in place until explicitly cleaned.

This group is mainly a stability test.  The *.chk files are part of the
repository and are rebuilt only seldom, when there is genuine reason for 
the behavior of the program to change.

== The master files ==

These are regression tests for individual parsing edge cases that 
consist of individual masters (extension ,v) paired with .chk files
that are git stream outputs.

== Incremental-dump regression ==

This is a specifically crafted test to see if incremental dumping of a 
late section of a repository works.

== Pathological repositories ==

These don't have regression tests yet.

QED.testrepo::
	contains a branch cycle.

twicedead.testrepo::
	contains a pathological master set to dead state twice.

== The t9600 group ==

The t960[1-4] files are tests taken from the git tree for testing the
cvsimport facility, adapted for testing cvs-fast-export directly.  The
t9605 test was composed by Chris Rorvick using the git test framework
but as of December 2013 has not been merged to the git tree.  These
are deliberately malformed repositories that exercise strange corner
cases.

Each repo has a custom-built script using the testlifter framework to check
properties of the CVS repository against properties of the git conversion.
The scripts perform tests equivalent to the Perl scripts in the originals.
